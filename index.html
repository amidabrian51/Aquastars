        <h3>Anyone Can Swim</h3>
        <p>The Team at Aquastars believe every child should be given the opportunity to swim safely and want your children to enjoy their lessons which plays a very important part in progression.
          This is the key ingredient that I look for when employing new swimming teachers.  Not only do they need to have the correct qualifications; but also recognise the benefits of delivering swimming  lessons with a fun element whilst teaching the FUNdamentals of this amazing life skill</p>
